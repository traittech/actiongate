## Txwrapper extensions

We use tx-wrapper (https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper-core) to build offline transactions, but the methods defined by tx-wrapper is limited, you can view the list here (https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper-core/tree/main/packages/txwrapper-substrate/src/methods). In this directory we add methods to generate the transaction for our custom pallets.
